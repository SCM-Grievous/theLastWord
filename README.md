The code in this repository was written for and is intended to be run on an Arduino Nano or comparable ATMega328P microcontroller board.  It implements a variety of functionality for the model weapon including:
* Muzzle flash effect with LEDs
* Sound effect using the PWM functionality of the ATMega328P
* Fully automatic and semi-automatic firing capabilities
* Realistic reload with tilt switch and magnet sensor
